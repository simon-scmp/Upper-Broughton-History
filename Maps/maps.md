## Historical Maps
#### Recent copies of two historical maps

Two significant historical maps exist of Upper Broughton. One drawn by Brett in 1833 and primarily intended as a reference to the land holdings of the Brett family. Currently the original is held by the family in New Zealand.

The second map pre-dates this and was drawn by Harding in approximately 1820 this exquisite map is drawn on paper from J. Whatman from their Turkey Mills and dated 1818.
