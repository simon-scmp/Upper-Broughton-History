This is the final working copy from VirtalBox Grav as of 10:28 Monday 12 Feb 2024
This should be fine to transfer to Grav on Krystal.

Make backups, notes and test again.

SC

March 2024

Has been noted that if the home page is edited in Grav Admin and re-saved then as soon as the save has been done one of the images becomes the background of the site and cannot be removed.

This applies on both the local version (this one) and the live site too. Manually replacing the original files doesn't seem to clear down the issue.

Have made backup of this site in folder: /pages_Bak_2Apr24

Now going to try removing the offending file and re-building the pages see if can clear the issue. I did have this before in testing and managed to clear quite easily but not now!

Folder 01.Home has now been updated in the production folder and will need updating here.
