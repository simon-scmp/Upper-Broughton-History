Until 1835 he lived in Masham in North Yorkshire where he was a curate, ran a Grammar School and a Boarding School and had a farm. From 1808 until his death in 1853 he was the Rector of Upper Broughton and received the rent from the glebe lands and church properties in this village which came to about £400 per year. When absent from Upper Broughtone (1808-1835) he would have employed a curate to look after the good folks there.</h4>
<p>Whilst holidaying in Kent last year we came across this plaque on the wall of Beckley Church:</p>
<p><img src="Marsden_1.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>How strange to see this plaque, because in Upper Broughton (often referred to as Broughton Sulney) we have a very similar plaque:</p>
<p><img src="Marsden_2.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>And then I found a book online called ‘The history and antiquities of Masham and Mashamshire; together with an account of its several franchises, its ancient lords, rectors, prebendaries, vicars, curates, etc., etc.; and appendixes, containing copies of several charters, grants, and other important documents‘ by John Fisher of Masham.</p>
<p>In the book there is a reference to a similar gift being made in Masham :</p>
<p>“Marsden&rsquo;s  Charity. — Mrs.  Marsden,  of  Hanover
Terrace,  Regent&rsquo;s  Park,  London,  gave  £220  3  per  cent,
consolidated  bank  annuities,  and  caused  the  same  to  be
transferred  on  the  22nd  February,  1842,  to  the  late  Rev.
Thomas  Riddell,  Vicar  of  Masham,  William  Burrill,
(now  of  Liverpool)  and  the  late  John  Burrill  in  trust,
viz : — the  interest  to  be  applied  annually  for  the  benefit
of  such  poor  people  of  the  Parish  of  Masham,  as  the  said
trustees  in  their  discretion  shall  think  proper. — The
Vicar  of  Masham  for  the  time  being  is  always  considered
as  one  of  the  trustees”</p>
<p>So we have three churches all getting an endowment from a Mrs Marsden who lives at a very prestigious address in Regent&rsquo;s Park.</p>
<p>The connection would appear to be that Mrs Marsden, nee Wrather, was the sister of Lucinda Wrather who married Rev Joseph Burrill, the Rector of Upper Broughton. They all came from Masham. Mrs Marsden&rsquo;s daughter Elizabeth married the Rev William Glaister, the Rector of Beckley. Mrs Marsden was the wife of Robert Marsden who was a stockbroker. They were involved with many charities and these endowments to the churches in Masham (her birthplace), Beckley (where her son in law was Rector) and Upper Broughton (where her brother in law was Rector) are an example of their generosity</p>
<p>The book continues:
“The  Rev.  Joseph Burrill was born at Masham  in  1764,  and  was  the
only  son  of  the  late  Joseph  Burrill  of  Masham  (who  died  23rd  of  October,
1806,  aged  76  years)  and  Elizabeth  his  wife,  (who  died  29th  of  October,
1810,  aged  75  years.)  He, on the  20th  of  June,  1794,  married  Lucinda,
daughter  of  the  late  William  Wrather  of  Masham,  by  whom  he  had  eight
children,  viz  :— I.  Charles,  who  died  20th  July,  1802,  aged  1  year.  II.  Wil-
liam, now  of  Liverpool.  HI.  Joseph,  who  was  a  solicitor  in  Masham,  and
died  suddenly  on  the  22nd  of  March,  1830,  aged  34  years.  IV.  John,  who,
on  Sept.  26th,  1826,  married  Anne  daughter  of  the  late  James  Blackburn
of  Masham,  deceased,  by  whom  he  left  issue.  He  died  14th  June,  1846,
aged  48  years.  V.  Thomas,  who  died  11th  Sept.,  1827,  aged  24  years.
VI.  James.  VII.  Mary.  VIII.  Elizabeth,  now  the  widow  of  the  late  Rev.
William  Glaister.</p>
<p>Besides  being  Curate  of  Masham,  he  was  also,  for  very  many  years  the
Head  Master  of  the  Grammar  School  at  Masham,  and  the  proprietor  of  a
very  extensive  Boarding  School  here,  which,  in  its  day,  was  held  in  very
high  repute.  His  predecessor,  as  Head  Master  of  the  Grammar  School,
was  a  Mr.  Wilson  ;  and  his  immediate  successor  in  it  was  Mr.  Edmund
Barker  of  Masham ;  who  has  been  again  succeeded  by  Mr.  Henry  Stubbs,
the  present  master.”</p>
<p>An interesting excerpt from the same book discusses the situation at the church in Masham in 1791 when the Rev William Lawson arrived in Masham:</p>
<p><em>“In  the  early  part  of  Mr.  Lawson&rsquo;s  incumbency,  whilst  he  was  travelling  in  France, during  the  time  of  the  war  between  England  and  that country,  he  was  taken  prisoner  and  detained  there  for  a long  time.  On  being  liberated  at  the  conclusion  of  the peace,  he  retired  to  Kirkby  Malzeard,  and  there  built  him-self the  present  parsonage-house,  and,  having  surrounded it  with  high  walls,  he  shut  himself  up  in  it,  and  was rarely  or  ever  seen  afterwards,  or  at  all  events  by  his parishioners  at  Masham.  The  consequence  was,  that during  his  long  incumbency  of  forty-two  years  every- thing connected  with  the  parish  and  his  cure  was  neglected, the  sole  charge  of  this  wide  and  extensive  parish being  committed  to  his  curate,  the  late  Rev Joseph Burrill.  Considering  that  Mr.  Burrill  during  the  time he  so  held  the  curacy  was  carrying  on  a  large  and  flourishing boarding-school — was  the  Head  Master  of  the  Grammar School — and  was  at  the  same  time  personally  managing a  farm  which  he  rented,  it  will  be  readily  seen that  he  could  not  pay  that  attention  to  the  spiritual  concerns  of  the  Parish,  and  of  its  inhabitants,  which  its importance  demanded,  or  which  ought  to  have  been  be- stowed upon  it.  Very  few  improvements  were  therefore effected  in  the  church  during  this  incumbency.”</em></p>
<p>Given that Rev Joseph Burrell spent limited time on the parish in Masham, it is interesting to note that from 1808 he was also Rector of Broughton Sulney (Upper Broughton). Who looked after the good people of Upper Broughton until September 1835 when Rev Joseph Burrill renounced his curacy in Masham? Having served the people there for 50 years, they presented him with a silver tray and he moved south to the Rectory in Upper Broughton.</p>
<p>Lucinda died here in 1839 and there is a plaque in the chancel erected by her husband</p>
<p><img src="L-Burrill.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Reverend Joseph Burrill died in 1853. They are both buried in the churchyard in Upper Broughton, but there is no gravestone for them. They outlived several of their children who were buried in Masham and do have headstones.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Masham is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In  memory  of  the  Reverend  Joseph  Burrill  who
died  March  1st,  1853,  aged  eighty-nine  years.  He  was forty-nine  years  curatej  of  this  his  native  place,  and  late
Rector  of  Broughton  Sulney,  Notts.  Also  of  Lucinda
his  wife,  eldest  daughter  of  the  late  William  Wrather  of
Masham,  Esq.  She  died  June  4th,  1839,  aged  seventy-
six  years.  Their  remains  lie  interred  in  the  church  of
Broughton  Sulney.”</p>
