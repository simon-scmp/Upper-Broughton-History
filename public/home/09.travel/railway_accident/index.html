<blockquote>
<p>Marriott was one of a gang of seven men who were engaged in packing up the down line at the south end of Upper Broughton Station. Owing to the curvature of the line, approaching trains on both lines could only be seen for a distance of about 200 yards. About 9.45am Thomas Goodman, the ganger, noticed that an empty waggon train was approaching on the down line. He called out &lsquo;Stand clear of both roads&rsquo; and all the men with the exception of Marriott, stepped into a position of safety outside the up line. After giving the warning, Goodman, who was on the line between the platforms, climbed onto the up platform. As he did so he noticed that the 9.34am express passenger train from Nottingham to Melton Mowbray was approaching on the up line. he looked towards the south end of the station and saw that Marriott was standing foul of the up line, with his back against the up platform. he shouted a warning to him, but Marriott was unable to get clear, and was struck and fatally injured by the engine of the express.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accident must be attributed to the fact that Marriott failed to stand clear of all lines in accordance with Rule 273A.</p>
<p>Marriott had been in the service of the company for ten years, and was classed as an &ldquo;extra&rdquo; man, though he had occasionally, as on the date of the accident, worked with an ordinary &ldquo;length&rdquo; gang. He was supplied with a rule book when he joined the service, but I was unable to ascertain definitely whether he was properly acquainted with the rules, owing to the fact that Rule 241 had not been observed in connection with the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; men employed in this district. If the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; men are required to work under the same conditions as the ordinary &ldquo;length&rdquo; men, it is necessary that they should have an equal knowledge of the Rules, and the Company&rsquo;s attention should be drawn to this point.</p>
<p>Although in this case the warning given by Goodman would have prevented the accident if Marriott had acted in accordance with the rules, I consider that the gang should not have been allowed to work on the line at this point, except under the protection of a special &ldquo;look out&rdquo; man. If such a &ldquo;look out&rdquo; man had been appointed, he would doubtless have been standing in a position of safety on the up platform, and it is more than probable that he would have noticed Marriott&rsquo;s position in time to give warning of the approach of the up train.</p>
<p>From the evidence given by Goodman and John W Holmes, the permanent way inspector, I am satisfied that Rule 9 of the Prevention of Accident Rules has not hitherto been properly observed in this district, and it is to be hoped hat the Company will take the necessary steps to ensure that this important Rule is strictly enforced in future.&rsquo;</p>
