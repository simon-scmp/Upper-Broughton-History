      <description>The Broughton Chest - Discovered here in Upper Broughton We had an exciting find in the village and set up a working party to delve into the contents of an old metal trunk full of papers. We know that it came out of Broughton House in the mid 1970s and contains 250 documents, some of which are almost 400 years old. We are very pleased to hear that Nottingham University are going to accept these records into their archive, to ensure their future preservation and access for researchers.</description>

      <description>Early history of farming in Upper Broughton. The geology of the parish and its influence on the first farming families to live here. Farming photos (Opens a Dropbox gallery)&#xA;The land in Upper Broughton parish is mainly clay with occasional bands of limestone. The hilltops to the west and north are covered in glacial clays which are often sticky and heavy to work, though there are also patches of sand. This land is also the higher part of the parish and has little shelter from the cold north and east winds, it was the last part of the parish to keep some shrubby tree cover and until recently was not ploughed but used as pasture.</description>

      <description>Evacuees Children evacuated from Great Yarmouth to Upper Broughton during WW2 In 1940, three teachers and forty children were evacuated from Northgate School in Great Yarmouth to Upper Broughton. Great Yarmouth was potentially a dangerous place. It had a submarine base and during World War II it suffered Luftwaffe bombing as it was the last significant place German bombers could drop bombs before returning home.&#xA;The children came by train to Melton Mowbray and then they boarded buses and were transported to various villages.</description>

      <description>A retrospective glance at education in Upper Broughton Education for the children in our Village today is taken as a given. It has not always been so. Historical Perspective Going much further back to earlier centuries, some education took place in informal Parish schools, or perhaps using an odd corner or porch of the church, where religion was taught from the Bible. Children were taught to read, some in Latin.</description>

As well as the German attacks on ships bringing food in, there were fewer men at home to work the land as many of the labourers were fighting in the army.&#xA;So the Women’s Land Army was set up and thousands of women and girls volunteered to become farm workers.</description>

      <description>Food Rationing &amp;lsquo;Everybody had a pig&amp;rsquo; Before the Second World War Britain imported about 2/3rds of our food. After war was declared in September 1939, the British government had to cut down on the amount of food it brought in from abroad as German submarines started attacking British supply ships. There was a worry that this would lead to shortages of food supplies in the shops so the British government decided to introduce a system of rationing.</description>

      <description>Rev. Harvey Staunton. As part of the commemorations to mark the centenary of WW1, the History Group published biographies of the eight men on our War Memorial. One man whose name is not there is Harvey Staunton. And we only learnt about him when Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club unveiled a new memorial to the six men who had played for Nottinghamshire and who died in the war. One of them was Harvey Staunton who had been the Rector of Upper Broughton between 1907 and 1911.</description>

      <description>Village Buildings tour A brief description of some of the various styles and ages of village buildings The oldest part of the village lies between Church Lane and the Village Hall, it is thought that with the exception of the church and the lower part of Yew Tree House there is little of any antiquity to be seen. Numerous houses have been removed from this area over the last century, partially due to the road widening circa 1927.</description>

      <description>War Damage The village was unscathed, but Nottingham was badly damaged on May 8th 1941 ‘We were very lucky really, the only local attack was in Hickling where they had the incendiary bombs’&#xA;Audrey Jones&#xA;Nottingham&#xA;Nottingham was badly hit on the night of May 8th 1941, with many deaths and very severe damage. Yet the Nottingham Evening Post the next day painted an upbeat picture and also avoided mentioning which town it was that had been attacked, merely referring to an ‘East Midlands town’.</description>
