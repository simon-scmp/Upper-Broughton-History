We know that it came out of Broughton House in the mid 1970s and contains 250 documents, some of which are almost 400 years old.

    Broughton School Broughton School lies on the A606 between the villages of Upper Broughton and Nether Broughton. Unusually the school served two communities which lie in different counties (Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire) and as schools were funded by their counties, this came to produce adminstrative difficulties as time went by.
The 1870 Education Act heralded in compulsory education and obliged local authorities to provide primary education for all children aged 5 to 11.

The first written evidence we have about farming in the manor of Broughton is from 1086 in the Domesday Book. The detailed information, reported by men from the village, was recorded by officers of King William, probably at the Hundred meeting place near Bingham.

The land in Upper Broughton parish is mainly clay with occasional bands of limestone. The hilltops to the west and north are covered in glacial clays which are often sticky and heavy to work, though there are also patches of sand. This land is also the higher part of the parish and has little shelter from the cold north and east winds, it was the last part of the parish to keep some shrubby tree cover and until recently was not ploughed but used as pasture.

    Evacuees Children evacuated from Great Yarmouth to Upper Broughton during WW2 In 1940, three teachers and forty children were evacuated from Northgate School in Great Yarmouth to Upper Broughton. Great Yarmouth was potentially a dangerous place. It had a submarine base and during World War II it suffered Luftwaffe bombing as it was the last significant place German bombers could drop bombs before returning home.
The children came by train to Melton Mowbray and then they boarded buses and were transported to various villages.

Keyworth is first mentioned in writing in the Domesday Book dated 1086, though recent archaeological finds have discovered Roman artefacts in the parish outskirts suggesting human inhabitation of the area as far back as 800 AD. Keyworth originally developed as an agricultural community with the great majority of its inhabitants being farmers and field labourers.

    A retrospective glance at education in Upper Broughton Education for the children in our Village today is taken as a given. It has not always been so. Historical Perspective Going much further back to earlier centuries, some education took place in informal Parish schools, or perhaps using an odd corner or porch of the church, where religion was taught from the Bible. Children were taught to read, some in Latin.

    History of St Luke&rsquo;s Church The church was originally dedicated to St Oswald and there is a stone carving in the church porch, reputedly said to be of Oswald. The parish is called Broughton Sulney which was a previous name for the village. The word Sulney relates to the family that owned the manor in the thirteenth century.

Broughton Sulney, St Luke The village was called Broughton Sulney in the thirteenth century and that has remained as the ecclesiastical name of the parish.

Britain&rsquo;s Home Guard (originally called the Local Defence Volunteers - or LDV) was born on 14th May 1940. It was particularly aimed at those who were too old to fight or were working in a reserved occupation.
The government had wanted to rely on the Army and the Police; however reports began reaching the War Office concerning the appearance up and down the country of &lsquo;bands of civilians.

    Kindertransport Did any Jewish Children stay in Upper Broughton? During the 9 months before the outbreak of WWII, 10,000 Jewish children were transported to Britain from mainland Europe. These were known as the Kindertransports, or children transports.
Our village’s surprising and fascinating link to Kindertransport emerged during the interviews with current and former villagers for the Oral History Project.
Memories were shared of a young Jewish boy, of about 7, who’d travelled to this country, and our village, from either Austria or Germany.

    Land Girls Employed to work on farms during WW2 The Women’s Land Army In both the World Wars there was a real danger of Britain running out of food. As well as the German attacks on ships bringing food in, there were fewer men at home to work the land as many of the labourers were fighting in the army.
So the Women’s Land Army was set up and thousands of women and girls volunteered to become farm workers.

‘We did at the end of the war have a German prisoner that helped out on the farm…
It’s amazing, he lived in, but in the evening even in the winter on the coldest of nights we would sort of peer out of the kitchen window down the yard and he had a mirror and four nails banged in a wall to see and he stripped to the waist middle of winter and washed in cold water and shaved and he was like a beetroot when he had done.

Marriott was one of a gang of seven men who were engaged in packing up the down line at the south end of Upper Broughton Station. Owing to the curvature of the line, approaching trains on both lines could only be seen for a distance of about 200 yards.

    Food Rationing &lsquo;Everybody had a pig&rsquo; Before the Second World War Britain imported about 2/3rds of our food. After war was declared in September 1939, the British government had to cut down on the amount of food it brought in from abroad as German submarines started attacking British supply ships. There was a worry that this would lead to shortages of food supplies in the shops so the British government decided to introduce a system of rationing.

Numerous houses have been removed from this area over the last century, partially due to the road widening circa 1927.
