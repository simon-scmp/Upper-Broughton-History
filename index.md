*September 2023*.  A project for the [Upper Broughton History Group](http://upperbroughtonhistory.org.uk) to do a feasibility study on publishing an archive of leagal documents from the 1600's to 1800's. A large metal chest containing the documents had been living in a garage for many years. When opened the documents were in exceptional condition considering their age. There has been an amount of media and academic interest in this project. 

Volunteers have spent a lot of time extracting names, dates, places from the handwritten documents. Then photographing and cataloguing the bundles of documents as they came out of the chest.

What they are looking to do here is to publish the results both as online database  along with with links to the photographs of the original handwritten documents before they are handed over to local archives.
