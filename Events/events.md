**Barrow-on-Soar** is a facinating village whose name may have arisen from the usage of the locality as a burial ground as it falls along the **Great Salt Way** which passes via Barrow from Six Hills.
For over a thousand years, Barrow has been noted for its excellent quality of lime stone which is believed to have been used by the Romans for laying pavements  in Leicester; and the building of Kirby Muxloe Castle; Ramsgate Pier and many of the tube railways beneath London.
Other industries have included knitting, making chair-bottoms, cricket bats and clocks.
Not only does Barrow sit on the picturesque River Soar but a canal was constucted in 1794 giving access to Birmingham, Hull and London.

##### So much to see and all for Â£5.
There is parking at the **High Street Car Park** which is just off the roundabout in the centre of the village.
