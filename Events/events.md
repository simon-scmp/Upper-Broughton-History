# Upper Broughton History Group Events for 2026

### Vernemetum
Our next talk is on Wednesday January 28th, 2026, when Peter Liddle is coming to talk about:

**Vernemetum**
7pm in Upper Broughton Village Hall

In Roman times, between Upper Broughton and Willoughby-on-the Wolds stood the town of Vernemetum. It was one of a regularly-spaced network of towns in Roman Leicestershire.

The extent of the Roman settlement is not known, but small finds of tile and building materials have been turned up around the site of the cross-road at Broughton Lodge for a number of years; unpublished excavations conducted in 1948, recovery operations during road construction in 1963 and further unpublished excavations between 1964-66 all uncovered limited finds including mid-2nd and 3rd century pottery from buildings, hearths and pits along the line of the Roman road

We welcome Peter Liddle MBE - former County Archaeologist for Leicestershire – back to talk to us about the settlement.
